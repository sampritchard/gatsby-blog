title: "Plastic straws are not the real problem"
---

Right now an estimated 12.7 million tonnes of plastic – everything from plastic bottles and bags to plastic straws – end up in our oceans each year. That’s a truck load of rubbish a minute. There is no question that something needs to be done globally, and it seems that for the timebeing, a key focus for the UK and US are plastic straws. Why?

Plastic straw bans are going into place all over the [US and the UK](http://uk.businessinsider.com/plastic-straw-ban-why-are-there-so-many-2018-7), which is an amazing initiative. Why are they being banned? Supposedly, plastic straws are acting as the gateway plastic to harder plastic use. If we ban plastic straws, we can eventually ban plastic bags, bottles etc. Also, plastic straws are seen as a relatively easy target and simple change to make, and who can forget the turtle with the straw stuck up his nose:

Trash accumulates in 5 ocean garbage patches, with the largest being the [Great Pacific Garbage Patch](https://www.theoceancleanup.com/great-pacific-garbage-patch/) (GPGP). The GPGP covers an estimated surface area of 1.6 million square kilometers, an area twice the size of Texas or three times the size of France. The mass of the plastic is estimated at 80,000 tonnes (500 jumbo jets), and this figure is rising. A key question that people want to know is: what plastics make all of this up? I asked 100 people this question: 

<b>Do plastic straws account for 46% or 0.3% of the GPGP?</b>

76% of people asked presumed that plastic straws accounted for 46% of the GPGP. The wise owls amongst you will notice that this will not be the case based on the title of this blog. This isn't that surprising considering the amount of media coverage plastic straws is currently receiving. Surely it can't possibly be as low as 0.3%? Well, it is. I asked a further question:

<b>What % of the GPGP waste is made up out of discared fishing nets?</b>

The average answer was 4%. The correct answer is more than 10 times this amount - [46%](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-22939-w). Discared fishing nets account for an area 3x the size of the UK!

 That’s pretty worryingly wrong, and perhaps an example of our media focussing on a change which is relatively easy, but not particularly impactful. Its like being riddled with cancer whilst having a toothache. The majority of doctors wouldn’t recommend resolving the toothache first. If we reduced the discarding of fishing nets by just 1%, it would have more of an impact than doubling our plastic straw usage. DOUBLE!

I understand that from a psychological point of view, having a direct impact by not buying a plastic straw can reap rewards long term. However, I think we need more transparency in this research and consumers don’t seem to know what plastics are in our oceans and what impact we can make.

By focussing on these tiny changes that we can make, the impact is pretty much nonexistent. Why are we focussing so heavily on plastic straws rather than reducing the fishing in the oceans?

I keep seeing signs saying ‘Save our oceans, stop using plastic’, or my favourite ironic sign along the River Thames: ‘For fishes sake, stop throwing plastic’. I would argue, for fishes sake, lets stop eating the fish?
